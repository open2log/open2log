# open2log

open2log is non-profit project by open2roam MTÜ to track prices in grocery shops physically by crowdsourcing the data and by searching it online. 

Our goal is to save more time for everyone so that people who are more clever than us can focus on moonshots like cold fusion, quantum computing, affordable healthcare and just be more present with their families to raise the next generation of people with moral principles and willingness to help each other. Let's spend our time wisely, eventually we will all be dead.

Contributions and sponsorships are welcome. We mainly use Claude Code to build this service.
